# Elliptic curve primality proving

ECPP proves an integer prime by finding an elliptic curve point of sufficiently
large prime order. A certificate records the curve, point, modular inverses and
a certificate for that smaller prime. This library supplies the data, an
executable checker, conversion of PARI certificate text and a built-in search.

Import `HexECPPMathlib` for the theorem that checker acceptance implies
Mathlib's `Nat.Prime`, or `HexECPPMathlib.Native` to search from a primality
goal. The computational library here imports no Mathlib modules.
