# Verifying multiplication of an elliptic curve point

An elliptic curve primality certificate needs a finite point `Q` with
`q • Q = O`, where `q` is the smaller prime certified by the next link in
the chain. We calculate this multiple by binary doubling and addition.
Each division uses a supplied modular inverse, checked by multiplication;
the certificate cannot choose a different sequence of scalar bits.

The final size test is the exact integer form of
`q > (n^(1/4) + 1)²`, the strict inequality used with Hasse's bound.
